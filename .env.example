# TDX_TICKET_APP_IDS: Your TeamDynamix ticketing application ID(s) [REQUIRED]
# Single app: TDX_TICKET_APP_IDS=627
# Multiple apps (comma-separated): TDX_TICKET_APP_IDS=627,11,2
#
# How to find your app IDs:
# - Check URL when viewing tickets: /Apps/627/Tickets/...
# - Common IDs: 2 (IT), 11 (Facilities), 627+ (custom apps)
#
# When multiple app IDs are provided:
# - Ticket searches use the first app ID by default
# - Get/Update/Edit operations automatically try each app ID until finding the ticket
# - Successful app IDs are cached per ticket for faster subsequent requests
# - Order by frequency of use (most common first) for best performance
# - Claude AI can also specify appId parameter in tool calls to override
